# Image_Compression_using-KMeans
Compression of an image is done using K-Means Clustering Algorithm. Image compression is a type of data compression applied to digital images without degrading the quality of the image to an unacceptable level. The reduction in file size allows more images to be stored in a given amount of disk or memory space.
